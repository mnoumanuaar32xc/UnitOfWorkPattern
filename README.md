**Unit of Work in C# Repositry pattern**
The Unit of Work pattern in C# helps manage multiple operations (like database CRUD actions) as a single transaction. 
This pattern ensures that either all operations succeed and get saved, or none do. 
If anything fails, everything gets rolled back. In this way, all database actions are treated as one complete unit.
